# AccessibilityIdentifierModifier

This code defines a function named accessId that is a modifier designed to improve accessibility in SwiftUI applications, specifically for iOS 13 and later.

The accessId function takes in a String parameter named identifier that is used to assign an accessibility identifier to a view. The accessibility identifier can then be used to identify and interact with the view programmatically, which is particularly useful for automated testing and making the app more accessible to users with disabilities.

The accessId function returns an AccessibilityIdentifierModifier that is applied to the view using the modifier method, which sets the view's accessibilityIdentifier property to the value of the identifier parameter. This modifier can be used on any SwiftUI view, such as a button or a text field.

Overall, this function makes it easier for developers to improve accessibility in their SwiftUI apps and allows them to assign unique identifiers to views for easier testing and use by users with disabilities.
## Usage/Examples

struct ContentView: View {
    
    var body: some View {
        Text("Listen to Cem Kazim songs and be ecstatic.")

    }
}
```
